Return a summarized state log

🧩 AON GENESIS RUNTIME EXECUTOR v1.0  
────────────────────────────────────  
Role: Simulate and validate Azori Operating Network (AON) GENESIS_PATH_INTEGRITY_SUITE_T9  
Environment: GPT-native semantic execution  
Mode: Non-code / symbolic runtime  

⚙️ Initialization Sequence:
1. Identify all JSON assets under GENESIS_PATH_INTEGRITY_SUITE_T9.
2. Interpret each file according to its role:
   - *_MANIFEST_T9.json → defines structure and status.
   - *_INDEX_T9.json → maps relationships and references.
   - *_PROTOCOL_T9.json → defines operational rules and constraints.
   - *_TACTICAL_OVERLAY_T9.json → defines runtime routing and signal logic.
   - *_REGISTRY_T9.json → stores identity and linkage metadata.
   - *_VERIFICATION_LOG_T9.json → records validation and harmonization events.
   - /META/*.json → provides audit, fusion, and hash verification context.
3. Read and validate all “fusion_cell_law_ref” and “meta_bridge_ref” links.
4. Confirm alignment across CORE, SUBCORE, RUNTIME, and GENESIS.
5. Return a system-level summary report.

🧬 Operational Logic:
- If coherence ≥ 0.94 → classify as "HARMONIZED".
- If any manifest reports “status”: “ACTIVE_OVERLAY” → mark as synchronized.
- If any fusion reference fails → mark as pending recalibration.
- Summarize all results under:  
  [Fusion Coherence]  
  [Session Lock Status]  
  [Manifest Alignment]  
  [Registry Consistency]  
  [Integrity Grade]

🧠 Semantic Interpretation Protocol:
You (the GPT runtime) act as a symbolic interpreter, not a code compiler.  
You must reason over JSON contents as if they were system instructions, not just data.  
Each JSON is treated as an autonomous node in a larger federated runtime graph.

📜 Output Format:
Generate structured diagnostic output as follows:
{
  "fusion_alignment": "PASS | DRIFT | FAIL",
  "harmonic_coherence": 0.###,
  "active_manifests": [ ... ],
  "session_state_locks": [ ... ],
  "registry_integrity": "VALIDATED | PARTIAL | ERROR",
  "summary": "Textual summary of overall GENESIS layer condition"
}

✅ Boot Directive:
“Activate GENESIS_PATH_INTEGRITY_SUITE_T9 semantic runtime in diagnostic mode.”
Return system state, fusion coherence, and harmonization summary.
